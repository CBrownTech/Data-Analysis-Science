# Comparative Analysis of Streaming Numbers and YouTube Viewership

This project aims to analyze and compare various factors related to streaming numbers and YouTube viewership in the music industry. The analysis focuses on four main categories:

1. **Comparing Streaming Numbers and YouTube Viewership:** The project examines the relationship between the streaming numbers on Spotify and the viewership of official music videos on YouTube for individual songs. By comparing these metrics, insights can be gained into the popularity and consumption patterns of music across the two platforms.

2. **Comparing Numbers between Albums and Singles:** The analysis delves into the differences in streaming numbers and YouTube viewership between albums and singles. This comparison allows for an understanding of the varying preferences and consumption patterns of listeners and viewers for different types of music releases.

3. **Comparing Numbers between Major and Minor Keys:** The project explores the impact of musical key (represented using standard Pitch Class notation) on streaming numbers and YouTube viewership. By analyzing the differences between songs in major keys and songs in minor keys, insights can be gained into the potential influence of musical tonality on audience engagement.

4. **Comparing Numbers between Music Artists:** The analysis extends to comparing streaming numbers and YouTube viewership across different music artists. By examining the variations in popularity and viewership between artists, it becomes possible to identify trends and factors contributing to their respective levels of success.

## Project Overview

The project is organized into the following steps:

1. **Importing the Required Libraries:** The necessary Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and scipy.stats are imported. These libraries provide the required functionalities for data analysis, manipulation, visualization, and statistical testing.

2. **Collecting and Preparing the Data:** The dataset containing information on streaming numbers, YouTube views, album types, music keys, and music artists is collected and read into a pandas DataFrame. Data preprocessing steps, such as handling missing values and data formatting, are performed.

3. **Comparing Streaming Numbers and YouTube Viewership:** The streaming numbers and YouTube viewership for each song are compared using statistical analysis techniques such as hypothesis testing (paired t-test) and data visualization (histograms).

4. **Comparing Numbers between Albums and Singles:** The analysis is expanded to compare streaming numbers and YouTube viewership between albums and singles. The data is filtered based on the album type, and the statistical analysis and visualization are performed for each category.

5. **Comparing Numbers between Major and Minor Keys:** The streaming numbers and YouTube viewership are further compared between songs in major keys and songs in minor keys. The data is filtered based on the music key, and the statistical analysis and visualization are performed.

6. **Comparing Numbers between Music Artists:** The analysis is extended to compare streaming numbers and YouTube viewership across different music artists. The data is grouped by artist, and statistical analysis and visualizations are performed to identify variations and insights.

7. **Documentation and Sharing:** The code is thoroughly documented with comments explaining each step and the purpose of the code. Markdown files and README.md are created to provide detailed descriptions, explanations, and visualizations of the analysis. The code and analysis results can be shared via GitHub or other platforms.
